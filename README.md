Machine Learning Repository
========================

This repository contains various Ipython Notebooks that I have created in order to document various online courses, ther Homeworks and Kaggle problems in Machine Learning and Data Science. Click on the link to browse the Jupyter Ipython Notebooks and python nodes

#### Kaggle Problems

 1. Titanic Survival Prediction - Classification Problem

#### Coursera - Machine Learning by Prof. Andrew NG, Stanford University

Although the course recommends that HomeWork should be done in MATLAB, I found skeletan Ipython notebooks where I could fill relevant codes in the code blocks. These skeleton notebooks were prepared by @noammor and can be found in her/his repository. Please find them <a href="https://github.com/noammor/coursera-machinelearning-python"> here </a><br/>
