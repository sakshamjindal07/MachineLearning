Machine Learning Repository
========================

This repository contains various Ipython Notebooks that I have created in order to document various online courses, ther Homeworks and Kaggle problems in Machine Learning and Data Science. Click on the link to browse the Jupyter Ipython Notebooks and python nodes

#### Kaggle Problems

Titanic Survival Prediction - Classification Problem

#### Coursera - Machine Learning by Prof. Andrew NG, Stanford University

Although the course recommends that HomeWork should be done in MATLAB, I found skeletan Ipython notebooks where I could fill relevant codes in the code blocks. These skeleton notebooks were prepared by @noammor and can be found in her/his repository. Please find them <a href="https://github.com/noammor/coursera-machinelearning-python"> here </a><br/> My repository contains implemetation of various machine learning algorithms as a part of the course homework.

#### Sentdex - Practical Machine Learning

Sentdex is a popular machine learnig YouTube channel and a python blogger. I followed along sentdex's 'Practical Machine Learning' and implemented algorithms - Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines , Nearest Neighbour , K-Means algorithm from scratch and by using sklearn simultaneously. These algorithms were applied to popular datasets - Google Stock Price Prediction, Breast Cancer Prediction, Titanic Dataset. These codes can be accessed in the subdirectory of the repository or by clicking <a href="https://github.com/sakshamjindal07/MachineLearning/tree/master/practicalML"> here </a><br/>
