## Coursera - Machine Learning by Prof. Andrew NG, Stanford University

Although the course recommends that HomeWork should be done in MATLAB, I found skeletan Ipython notebooks where I could fill relevant codes in the code blocks. These skeleton notebooks were prepared by @noammor and can be found in her/his repository. Please find them <a href="https://github.com/noammor/coursera-machinelearning-python"> here </a><br/> My repository contains implemetation of various machine learning algorithms as a part of the course homework.
